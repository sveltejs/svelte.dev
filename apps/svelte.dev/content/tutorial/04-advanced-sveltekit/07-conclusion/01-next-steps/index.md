Congratulations! If you've made it the entire way through this tutorial, you can now consider yourself a Svelte and SvelteKit expert.

You can start building apps on your own machine with [Svelte CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sv):

```bash
npx sv create
```

Svelte and SvelteKit will continue to evolve, and so will this tutorial. Check back periodically for updates.
