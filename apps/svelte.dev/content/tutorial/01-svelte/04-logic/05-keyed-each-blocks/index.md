title: Keyed each blocks
---

By default, when you modify the value of an `each` block, it will add and remove DOM nodes at the _end_ of the block, and update any values that have changed. That might not be what you want.

It's easier to show why than to explain. Inside `Thing.svelte`, `name` is a dynamic prop but `emoji` is a constant.

Click the 'Remove first thing' button a few times, and notice what happens:

1. It removes the last component.
2. It then updates the `name` value in the remaining DOM nodes, but not the emoji.

> [!NOTE] If you're coming from React, this might seem strange, because you're used to the entire component re-rendering when state changes. Svelte works differently: the component 'runs' once, and subsequent updates are 'fine-grained'. This makes things faster and gives you more control.

One way to fix it would be to make `emoji` a [`$derived`](derived-state) value. But it makes more sense to remove the first `<Thing>` component altogether than to remove the _last_ one and update all the others.

To do that, we specify a unique _key_ for each iteration of the `each` block:

```svelte
/// file: App.svelte
{#each things as thing (+++thing.id+++)}
	<Thing name={thing.name}/>
{/each}
```

> [!NOTE] You can use any object as the key, as Svelte uses a `Map` internally â€” in other words you could do `(thing)` instead of `(thing.id)`. Using a string or number is generally safer, however, since it means identity persists without referential equality, for example when updating with fresh data from an API server.
