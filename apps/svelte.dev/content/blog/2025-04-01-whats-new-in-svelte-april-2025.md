With a couple minor releases of SvelteKit in the last month and a few more from Svelte itself, there's a lot to be excited about this month. From new helper functions to new configuration options, we've got a lot to cover...

So let's dive in!

## What's new in Svelte

- The new `idPrefix` option for `render` makes client-side ID generation more reliable in the rare cases that multiple Svelte runtimes exist on a page (**5.22.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/svelte-server#render), [#15428](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15428))
- State created in deriveds/effects can now be written/read locally without self-invalidation - reducing the number of "unsafe read"s significantly (**5.24.0**, [#15553](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15553))
- Derived statements are now writable (**5.25.0/5.25.2**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$derived#Overriding-derived-values), [#15570](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15570) and [#15581](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15581))
- The Svelte CLI also got an upgrade to its code generation for more intuitive formatting (**0.7.0**, [#380](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/pull/380))
- `eslint-plugin-svelte` v3 has been released. The main update is improved support for Svelte 5. Check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/eslint-plugin-svelte/releases) for more details.

There were also quite a few [fixes](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/releases/tag/extensions-109.5.3) to the language tools earlier in the month - so be sure to keep your plugins up to date!

## What's new in SvelteKit

- `reroute` can now be called async - with an option to `fetch` if you need to pass along cookies or other request context (**2.18.0/2.19.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/@sveltejs-kit#Reroute), [#13520](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13520) and [#13549](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13549))
- The new `normalizeUrl` helper provides people a way to normalize a raw URL that could contain SvelteKit-internal data (**2.18.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/@sveltejs-kit#normalizeUrl), [#13539](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13539))
- `getRequestEvent` is a new function in `$app/server` that returns the current `RequestEvent` (**2.20.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/$app-server#getRequestEvent), [#13582](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13582))
- Updates to the `cloudflare-adapter` brings Wrangler 4 support, improved `_headers` and `_redirects` files, and support for specifically building for Cloudflare Workers Static Assets (**5.1.0-7.0.0**, [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/main/packages/adapter-cloudflare/CHANGELOG.md))
