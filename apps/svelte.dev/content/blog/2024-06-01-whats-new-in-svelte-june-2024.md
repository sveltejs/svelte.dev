The maintainers have been hard at work getting the [Svelte 5 Release Candidate](/blog/svelte-5-release-candidate) ready for release. In this month's newsletter, you'll find highlights from the pre-release [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/main/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md) and a host of items from our community showcase.

Let's dive in!

## What's new in Svelte

- `bind:` is now disallowed on component exports in runes mode and has much better types to tell if a prop is `$bindable` (**5.0.0-next.113, 114 and 125**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/runes#bindable), [#11238](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/11238), [#11225](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/11225) and [#11498](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/11498))
- Tons of work on the `migrate` tool to make migrating to Svelte 5 syntax easier (**5.0.0-next.116, 136 and 137**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/old-vs-new), [#11334](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/11334), [#11659](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/11659), [#11704](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/11704))
- MathML is now supported (**5.0.0-next.120**, [Docs](https://www.w3.org/TR/mathml-core/#mathml-elements-and-attributes), [#11387](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/11387))
- The Svelte Inspector is now supported (**5.0.0-next.125**, [Docs](https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte/blob/main/docs/inspector.md), [#11514](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/11514))
- The `$state.is` rune lets you compare values or check if an object exists within a deeply reactive object/array (**5.0.0-next.134**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/runes#state-is), [#11613](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/11613))
- The `rootDir` compiler option makes filenames relative to simplify development in monorepos or complex folder structures (**5.0.0-next.135**, [#11627](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/11627))
