With [Async Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/discussions/15845) and its companion [Remote Functions](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/13897) officially out in the world, there's a lot of updates to share!

Be sure to check out the showcase for videos from Rich, Paolo, and Stanislav about all the brand new features in Svelte.

Let's dive into the highlights...

## What's new in Svelte, SvelteKit, Language Tools and CLI (sv)

- Remote functions can be called anywhere in your app, but always run on the server, and as such can safely access server-only modules containing things like environment variables and database clients (**kit@2.27.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions), [#13986](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13986))
- `getAbortSignal` returns an `AbortSignal` that aborts when the current derived or effect re-runs or is destroyed (**svelte@5.35.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/svelte#getAbortSignal), [#16266](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/16266))
- A new `parent` property has been added to the `__svelte_meta` properties that are added to elements at dev time - useful for debugging nested hierarchies (**svelte@5.35.1**, [#16255](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/16255))
- `await` is now supported in components when using the `experimental.async` compiler option (**svelte@5.36.0/extensions@109.10.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/await-expressions), [#15844](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15844))
- There are now types for the `params` prop and `page` attributes in page/layout components (**kit@2.24.0, kit@2.26.0 & extensions@109.10.0**, [#13999](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13999) / [#13864](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13864))
- SvelteKit's `read` now works in edge environments where `fs.readFile` isn't available such as in Cloudflare's workers, Netlify, and Vercel's edge functions (**kit@2.25.0**, [#13859](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13859))
- The `resolve(...)` and `asset(...)` helpers have been added for resolving paths (**kit@2.26.0**, [#13864](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13864))
- Support for modern SvelteKit prop typings has been added to VS Code snippets (**extensions-109.10.0**, [#2796](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/2796))
- The new `vite.addPlugin` simplifies adding a plugin on various vite config styles (**sv@0.8.20**, [#633](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/pull/633))
- vite-plugin-svelte is out with support for vite7, rolldown-vite and [more](https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte/blob/main/packages/vite-plugin-svelte/CHANGELOG.md)
