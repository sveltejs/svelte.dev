description: 'Svelte MCP, typed contexts and improved form validation in remote functions'

The official Svelte MCP server (for all your agentic needs) is now available with its own [section of the docs site](https://svelte.dev/docs/mcp/overview) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sveltejs/mcp). If you haven't gotten a chance to try it out with the AI of your choice, definitely take it for a spin. It should replace the copy/pasting of the Svelte docs that's often required to get LLMs to write valid Svelte 5 code and can provide suggestions on the generated code with static analysis.

But it's not just AIs that have been writing code; our maintainers have too! Let's take a look at what they've been up to in Svelte/Kit before diving into our community showcase...

## What's new in Svelte

- `createContext` passes types with a stored context - replacing the need to type every `getContext` return value (**5.40.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/svelte#createContext), [#16948](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/16948))
- The `$state.eager(value)` rune will update the UI immediately instead of waiting for the correspnding `await` to resolve (**5.41.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/state#state.eager), [#16849](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/16849))
- The `fork` API lets you change some state 'offscreen' in such a way that you can discover any async work resulting from the state change without committing it to the screen. (**5.42.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/await-expressions#Forking), [#17004](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/17004))

For a full list of changes - including the dozens of valuable bugfixes that went into the releases this month - check out the Svelte compiler's [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/main/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's new in SvelteKit

- `event.route` and `event.url` are now available in remote functions making it easier to know which page a remote function was called from (**2.44.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions), [#14606](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14606))
- `form.for(id)` will now implicitly set an id on the form object (**2.45.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions#form-Multiple-instances-of-a-form), [#14623](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14623))
- Form validation can now be done imperatively in cases where it can't be done via a schema (**2.46.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions#form-Programmatic-validation), [#14624](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14624))
- The new signal request property provides the `AbortSignal` associated with the request (**2.47.0**, [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/signal), [#14715](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14715))
- Kit will now use the `fork` API when it's available. See the Svelte updates above for more info (**2.48.0**, [#14793](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14793))
