A bunch of updates to Svelte dropped in the last few weeks, plus a few quality of life improvements in the Svelte language tools.

Let's take a look...

## What's new in Svelte and Language Tools

- `$state.frozen` has been replaced with `$state.raw` (**5.0.0-next.218**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/runes#state-raw), [#12808](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/12808))
- `$state.is` has been removed. RIP, little guy ([#12916](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/12916))
- `svelte:options` now lets you set the `css: "inject"` compiler option on a per-component basis (**5.0.0-next.209**, [#12660](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/12660))
- `<svelte:component>` is now unnecessary in runes mode and therefore is deprecated (**5.0.0-next.203/217**, [#12646](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/12646) and [#12694](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/12694))
- `:global` is now allowed in more places - making it easier to use in `<style>` tags and fixing issues with Tailwind's `@apply` (**5.0.0-next.199**, [Docs](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/main/documentation/docs/02-template-syntax/05-styles-and-classes.md), [#12560](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/12560))
- Svelte's typescript definition generator that comes with `@sveltejs/package` will now warn when its diagnostics detect that a `d.ts` file was not generated (**svelte2tsx@0.7.14**, [#2428](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/2428))
- You can now specify a tsconfig in `emitDts` - helpful when working in a monorepo (**svelte2tsx@0.7.16**, [#2454](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/2454))

Not covered in this list are a ton of efficiency and performance improvements across css and javascript compilation. If you're interested, check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/main/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md) for more on how destructuring, state proxies and actions/styles/classes have all improved since last month.
