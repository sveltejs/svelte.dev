This month's [Svelte Summit](https://www.sveltesummit.com/) in Barcelona was a glorious celebration of the community. We had lively conversations, delightful dinners, and funny, imaginative and thought-provoking talks.

For everyone who couldn't make it there in person, the conference also sold virtual tickets to the livestream, which give on-demand access to the talks. These ticket sales make it possible to (for example) hire AV technicians and ensure that the stream is reliable and high-quality. Running a conference is extremely difficult and time-consuming, and we're very grateful to [Svelte Society](https://bsky.app/profile/sveltesociety.dev) ([Kevin](https://bsky.app/profile/kevinak.se) in particular), [Mainmatter](https://mainmatter.com/), and everyone who bought a ticket for making the event a reality.

But we've heard from many of you that the talks should be freely available so that they can be shared with the widest possible audience and... we agree!

So the Svelte team has decided to sponsor the release of the talks, beginning this weekend. We're able to do this because of the generous financial support so many of you have given us via [opencollective.com/svelte](https://opencollective.com/svelte), which also funds important development work on the project.
