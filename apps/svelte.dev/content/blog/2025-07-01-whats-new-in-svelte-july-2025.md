Whether you're trying out Vite 7, vitest browser mode or [remote functions](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/13897), there's lots of experimental features to try this month.

Want some Svelte swag while you're chatting on Discord? With the new `sv ‚ö°` [server tag](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/31444248479639-Server-Tags#h_01JT6VKRACHQADX7EBXR84QTAQ), you do just that. While signed into Discord, you can adopt our tag via profile settings.

There's a bunch to cover, from blog posts to new libraries, so let's dive in...

## What's new in Svelte and SvelteKit

- `$inspect.trace` now includes source name logging to make it easy to find which file the log came from (**svelte@5.34.0**, [Docs](<https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$inspect#$inspect.trace()>), #[16060](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/16060))
- The latest version of SvelteKit now supports Vite 7 and Rolldown. Compilation should be faster using Rolldown, but with larger bundle sizes until additional tree-shaking is implemented in Rolldown (**kit@2.22.0**, [Docs](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown.html#how-to-try-rolldown), [#13747](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13747))

For a full list of bug fixes in Svelte, SvelteKit and its adapters, check out their CHANGELOGs [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/main/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md) and [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages).

## What's new in the CLI and Language Tools

- The `sv` CLI now supports Vite's browser mode in Vitest - allowing you to run your tests in the browser natively (**cli@0.8.12**, [Docs](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/), [#588](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/pull/588))
- The language server now makes it easier to search for symbol names (`Ctrl + T` in VSCode). Some of the handling is also synced to the Svelte TypeScript plugin so that it's more consistent, which also means vscode can better deduplicate the results from both tsserver and Svelte language server (**extensions@109.9.0**, [#2769](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/2769))
