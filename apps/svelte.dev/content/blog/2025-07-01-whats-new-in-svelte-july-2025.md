Whether you're trying out Vite 7, vitest browser mode or [remote functions](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/13897), there's lots of experimental features to try this month.

Plus, a bunch of new blog posts and libraries to try in the Showcase.

Let's dive in!

## What's new in Svelte and SvelteKit

- `$inspect.trace` now includes source name logging to make it easy to find which file the log came from (**svelte@5.34.0**, [Docs](<https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$inspect#$inspect.trace()>), #[16060](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/16060))
- The latest version of SvelteKit now supports Vite 7 and Rolldown. Compilation should be faster using Rolldown, but with larger bundle sizes until additional tree-shaking is implemented in Rolldown (**kit@2.22.0**, [Docs](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown.html#how-to-try-rolldown), [#13747](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13747))

For a full list of bug fixes in Svelte, SvelteKit and its adapters, check out their CHANGELOGs [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/main/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md) and [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages).

## What's new in the CLI and Language Tools

- The `sv` CLI now supports Vite's browser mode in `vitest` - allowing you to run your tests in the browser natively (**cli@0.8.12**, [Docs](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/), [#588](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/pull/588))
- The language server now makes it easier to search for symbol names (`Ctrl + T` in VSCode). Some of the handling is also synced to the typescript-plugin so that it's more consistent, which also means vscode can better deduplicate the results from both tsserver and Svelte language server (**extensions@109.9.0**, [#2769](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/2769))
