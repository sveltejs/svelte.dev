In addition to advancing the work on Async Svelte, the maintainers have been hard at work introducing long requested features like Attachments.

This month, we'll share a bit about the new API along with a huge showcase of apps/sites built with Svelte...

Let's dive in!

## What's new in Svelte and SvelteKit

- Attachments are essentially a more flexible and modern version of actions. Read more about their use-cases and improvements over actions in the PR ([#1500](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15000)) or in the [Svelte docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/@attach) (**svelte@5.29.0**, **language-tools@109.7.0**)
- Do you have actions you love and want to use them as attachments? The `fromAction` utility lets you convert actions into attachments (**svelte@5.32.0**, [#15933](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15933))
- Generics are now allowed on snippets - improving typing and type hints (**svelte@5.30.0**, **language-tools@109.8.0**, [#15915](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15915))
- The Svelte extension will now allow you to add missing imports on save (**language-tools@109.6.0**, [#2744](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/2744))
- State fields can now be declared inside class constructors (**svelte@5.31.0**, [#15820](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15820))
- Svelte is now XHTML compliant and the new `fragments: 'html' | 'tree'` option adds wider CSP compliance (**svelte@5.33.0**, [#15538](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15538))
- Client-side code is now allowed to run at the top-level of universal pages/layouts when SSR is disabled and page options are only boolean or string literals (**kit@2.21.0**, [#13684](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13684))
