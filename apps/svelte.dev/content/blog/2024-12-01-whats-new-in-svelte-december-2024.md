I can't believe it's already the last newsletter of the year! So much has happened in the Svelte community - from two great Svelte Summits to the release Svelte 5 ðŸŽ‰

As we look forward to the next year and watch the Svelte team do [24 features in 24 days](advent-of-svelte), let's dive into what's new in the past month...

## What's new in Svelte

The bugfix versions in 5.1.x and 5.2.x addressed a bunch of issues reported by the community. So if you're noticing anything weird, make sure you upgrade to the latest version and, as always, check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/main/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md) for all the bug fixes.

The features since last month can be found below:

- `ContentVisibilityAutoStateChangeEvent` has been added to element definitions (**5.2.5**, [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ContentVisibilityAutoStateChangeEvent), [#14373](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/14373))

## What's new in SvelteKit, Svelte CLI and Language Tools

- `isActionFailure` is a new helper method to check if a variable is an instanceof `ActionFailure` - helpful for debugging parsing of user input (**2.8.0**, [#12878](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/12878))
- `const load = ...` declarations will now be typed automatically (**svelte2tsx-0.7.23**, [#2540](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/2540))
- The CLI will now include a `jsconfig.json` in the 'no type checking' template (**0.6.2**, [#290](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/pull/290))
- When installing dependencies, the CLI will display the package manager's output (**0.6.3**, [#305](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/pull/305))
- A short description will now be shown for each add-on in the CLI menu (**0.6.5**, [#299](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/pull/299))
- Instance types will now be provided automatically in Svelte 5 (**svelte2tsx-0.7.23**, [#2553](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/2553))
- A code lens indicator for "runes mode" will now appear atop a file when detected - "legacy mode" when not (**language-server-0.17.4**, [#2554](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/2554))
