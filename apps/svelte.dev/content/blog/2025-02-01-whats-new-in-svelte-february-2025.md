The Svelte developer experience got a huge upgrade this month with more exported types and better syntax highlighting in VS Code. Combine that with the huge releases from Storybook, Tailwind and Threlte... and you've got a pretty big month!

Let's dive in üê¨

## What's new in Svelte

- Non-numeric values can now be tweened by snapping immediately to the new value (**5.17.0**, [Docs](/docs/svelte-motion#tweened), [#14941](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/14941))
- `const` tags are now allowed inside of a `svelte:boundary` (**5.17.5**, [Docs](/docs/svelte/svelte-boundary), [#14993](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/14993))
- `<template>` elements are now allowed to contain any child elements (**5.18.0**, [Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template), [#15007](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15007))
- `ClassValue` is now exposed from `svelte/elements` (**5.19.0**, [Docs](/docs/svelte/class#Attributes-Objects-and-arrays)), [#15035](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15035))

## What's new in SvelteKit and Language Tools

- Custom identifiers can now be invalidated on `goto()` navigation (**2.16.0**, [Docs](/docs/kit/$app-navigation#goto), [#13256](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13256))
- The `postinstall` script has been removed to support pnpm 10 (**2.16.0**, [#13304](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13304))
  - users should add `"prepare": "svelte-kit sync"` to their `package.json` in order to avoid the a warning upon first running Vite
- `PageProps` and `LayoutProps` types are now provided (**2.16.0**, [#13308](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13308))
- The generics attribute is now supported for JSDoc (**svelte2tsx-0.7.32/svelte-check-4.1.2**, [#2624](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/2624))
- Semantic document highlighting makes the document highlights based on semantic/syntactic meaning instead of the current word-based default by VSCode (**language-server-0.17.9**, [Docs](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_documentHighlight), [#1408](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/1408))
