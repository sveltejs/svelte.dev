There were lots of improvements to remote functions this month - including new batching tools and improved performance via lazy discovery. For more info, check out the Docs and PR links in each bullet. Async SSR is also available for those who would like to try it out while it's still experimental. It's included when the `config.experimental.async` setting is enabled.

We've got a hefty showcase this month too, so let's dive in!

## What's new in Svelte, SvelteKit and Svelte CLI (sv)

- The `event` property is now included on popstate, link and form navigation (**kit@2.40.0**, [#14307](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14307))
- The `%sveltekit.version%` placeholder can now be used in `app.html` to easily include the current SvelteKit version in the output (**kit@2.41.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/project-structure#Project-files-src), [#12132](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/12132))
- You can now create projects from the Svelte playground with `npx sv create --from-playground <url>` (**sv@0.9.5**, [#662](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/pull/662))
- Experimental async SSR is available in Svelte v5.39.3 and SvelteKit v2.43.0 or higher. You can opt-in via the `experimental.async` option. When this is enabled, it's possible to use `await` anywhere in your app, without wrapping it in a boundary with a pending snippet. You can find more information in the SvelteKit PR ([#14447](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14447), Svelte PR is [#16748](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/16748))

### Remote Functions

- The remote function `query.set()` can now be called on the server and `query.refresh()` promises will now be automatically resolved on the server (**kit@2.37.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions), [#14304](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14304), [#14332](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14332))
- The new `query.batch` remote function lets you batch requests that happen within the same macrotask (**kit@2.38.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions#query.batch), [#14272](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14272))
- Lazy discovery of remote functions improves detection and tree shaking for functions defined in `node_modules` (**kit@2.39.0**, [#14293](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14293))
- The `form` remote function has been enhanced with schema support, `input` and `issues` properties (**kit@2.42.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions#form), [#14383](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14383))
