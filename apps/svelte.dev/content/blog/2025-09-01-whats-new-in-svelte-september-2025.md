description: 'Deno support, await in consts and open telemetry support'

In case you missed it, the main Svelte blog covered how to use [SvelteKit's new OpenTelemetry traces](https://svelte.dev/blog/sveltekit-integrated-observability) to reliably set up observability instrumentation using instrumentation.server.ts. This month's round up covers that release and a few other features that rolled out before and after it.

Plenty in the showcase, as well, so let's dive in!

## What's new in Svelte and Svelte CLI (sv)

- `await` is now allowed inside `@const` declarations (**svelte@5.38.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/await), [#16542](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/16542))
- The `sv add` command has been updated to remove the `--no-preconditions` and add `--no-git-check`. With this new flag, even if some files are dirty, no prompt will be shown (**sv@0.9.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/cli/sv-add), [#650](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/pull/650))

## What's new in SvelteKit and its adapters

- Deno is now supported as a supported package manager (**sveltejs/adapter-auto@6.1.0**, [#14163](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14163))
- A new `instrumentation.server.ts` adds tracing and observability setup (**sveltejs/adapter-node@5.3.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/observability), [#13899](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13899))
- The `--preserve-output` flag prevents deletion of the output directory before packaging (**sveltejs/package@2.5.0**, [Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/packaging), [#13055](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13055))
