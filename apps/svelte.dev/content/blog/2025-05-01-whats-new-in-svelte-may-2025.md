Only a week until [Svelte Summit Spring 2025](https://www.sveltesummit.com/)! If you can't make it in-person to Barcelona, you can purchase a virtual ticket [here](https://www.sveltesummit.com/virtual-ticket).

But before that, we've got a few updates to highlight...

## What's new in Svelte and SvelteKit

The Svelte maintainers have been hard at work building out [Asynchronous Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/discussions/15845) this month, but still found the time to ship some helpful features. If you're interested in trying out the async branch, or just want to follow along with the development, check out [feat: allow await in components #15844](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15844)

- Certain expressions will now be partially evaluated to improve runtime performance (**svelte@5.27.0/5.28.0**, [#15494](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15494)/[#15781](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15781))
- The Svelte CLI (`sv`) has added a `--install <package-manager>` flag to `create` and `add` to specify which package manager to use when running (**cli@0.8.1**, [#531](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/pull/531))
- The two separate CloudFlare adapters have been merged into one: `adapter-cloudflare` (**adapter-cloudflare@7.0.0**, [#13634](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13634))
- `adapter-vercel` will now create symlink functions for each route, for better observability (**adapter-vercel@5.7.0**, [#13679](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13679))

There were a number of fixes in SvelteKit too - including an improvement to the `HandleServerError` hook to give it access to `getRequestEvent`! ([#13666](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13666))

For a full list of bug fixes in Svelte, SvelteKit and its adapters, check out their CHANGELOGs [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/main/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md) and [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages).
