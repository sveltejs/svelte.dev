SvelteKit makes three read-only state objects available via the `$app/state` module â€” `page`, `navigating` and `updated`.

> [!NOTE]
> This module was added in 2.12. If you're using an earlier version of SvelteKit, use [`$app/stores`]($app-stores) instead.



```js
// @noErrors
import { navigating, page, updated } from '$app/state';
```

## navigating

A read-only object representing an in-progress navigation, with `from`, `to`, `type` and (if `type === 'popstate'`) `delta` properties.
Values are `null` when no navigation is occurring, or during server rendering.

<div class="ts-block">

```dts
const navigating:
	| import('@sveltejs/kit').Navigation
	| {
			from: null;
			to: null;
			type: null;
			willUnload: null;
			delta: null;
			complete: null;
	  };
```

</div>



## page

A read-only reactive object with information about the current page, serving several use cases:
- retrieving the combined `data` of all pages/layouts anywhere in your component tree (also see [loading data](/docs/kit/load))
- retrieving the current value of the `form` prop anywhere in your component tree (also see [form actions](/docs/kit/form-actions))
- retrieving the page state that was set through `goto`, `pushState` or `replaceState` (also see [goto](/docs/kit/$app-navigation#goto) and [shallow routing](/docs/kit/shallow-routing))
- retrieving metadata such as the URL you're on, the current route and its parameters, and whether or not there was an error

```svelte
<!--- file: +layout.svelte --->
<script>
	import { page } from '$app/state';
</script>

<p>Currently at {page.url.pathname}</p>

{#if page.error}
	<span class="red">Problem detected</span>
{:else}
	<span class="small">All systems operational</span>
{/if}
```

On the server, values can only be read during rendering (in other words _not_ in e.g. `load` functions). In the browser, the values can be read at any time.

<div class="ts-block">

```dts
const page: import('@sveltejs/kit').Page;
```

</div>



## updated

A read-only reactive value that's initially `false`. If [`version.pollInterval`](/docs/kit/configuration#version) is a non-zero value, SvelteKit will poll for new versions of the app and update `current` to `true` when it detects one. `updated.check()` will force an immediate check, regardless of polling.

<div class="ts-block">

```dts
const updated: {
	get current(): boolean;
	check(): Promise<boolean>;
};
```

</div>
