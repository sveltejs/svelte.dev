```js
// @noErrors
import { base, build, files, prerendered, version } from '$service-worker';
```

This module is only available to [service workers](/docs/service-workers).

## base

The `base` path of the deployment. Typically this is equivalent to `config.kit.paths.base`, but it is calculated from `location.pathname` meaning that it will continue to work correctly if the site is deployed to a subdirectory.
Note that there is a `base` but no `assets`, since service workers cannot be used if `config.kit.paths.assets` is specified.

<div class="ts-block">

```ts
// @noErrors
const base: string;
```

</div>

## build

An array of URL strings representing the files generated by Vite, suitable for caching with `cache.addAll(build)`.
During development, this is an empty array.

<div class="ts-block">

```ts
// @noErrors
const build: string[];
```

</div>

## files

An array of URL strings representing the files in your static directory, or whatever directory is specified by `config.kit.files.assets`. You can customize which files are included from `static` directory using [`config.kit.serviceWorker.files`](/docs/kit/reference/configuration)

<div class="ts-block">

```ts
// @noErrors
const files: string[];
```

</div>

## prerendered

An array of pathnames corresponding to prerendered pages and endpoints.
During development, this is an empty array.

<div class="ts-block">

```ts
// @noErrors
const prerendered: string[];
```

</div>

## version

See [`config.kit.version`](/docs/kit/reference/configuration#version). It's useful for generating unique cache names inside your service worker, so that a later deployment of your app can invalidate old caches.

<div class="ts-block">

```ts
// @noErrors
const version: string;
```

</div>
