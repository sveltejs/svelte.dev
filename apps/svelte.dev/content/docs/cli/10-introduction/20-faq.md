## How do I run the `sv` CLI?

Running `sv` looks slightly different for each package manager. Here is a list of the most common commands:

- **npm** : `npx sv create`
- **pnpm** : `pnpx sv create` or `pnpm dlx sv create`
- **Bun** : `bunx sv create`
- **Deno** : `deno run npm:sv create`
- **Yarn** : `yarn dlx sv create`

## `npx sv` is not working

Some package managers prefer to run locally installed tools instead of downloading and executing packages from the registry. This issue mostly occurs with `npm` and `yarn`. This usually results in an error message or looks like the command you were trying to execute did not do anything.

Here is a list of issues with possible solutions that users have encountered in the past:

- [`npx sv` create does nothing](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/issues/472)
- [`sv` command name collides with `runit`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/issues/259)
- [`sv` in windows powershell conflicts with `Set-Variable`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/issues/317)
