Svelte 5 came with some significant changes to Svelte's API. These include runes, snippets and event attributes. As a result some of the API known from Svelte 3 and 4 is deprecated and will be removed at some point in the future. It is advised to incrementally migrate towards the new syntax, see the [migration guide](v5-migration-guide) for more info.

That said, this legacy syntax is still available today and can be used side by side with the new syntax. The following pages contain reference documentation of said syntax.
