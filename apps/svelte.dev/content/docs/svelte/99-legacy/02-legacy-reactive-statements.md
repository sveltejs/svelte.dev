title: $:

Any top-level statement (i.e. not inside a block or a function) can be made reactive by prefixing it with the `$:` [JS label syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label). Reactive statements run after other script code and before the component markup is rendered, whenever the values that they depend on have changed.

```svelte
<script>
	export let title;
	export let person;

	// this will update `document.title` whenever
	// the `title` prop changes
	$: document.title = title;

	$: {
		console.log(`multiple statements can be combined`);
		console.log(`the current title is ${title}`);
	}

	// this will update `name` when 'person' changes
	$: ({ name } = person);

	// don't do this. it will run before the previous line
	let name2 = name;
</script>
```

Only values which directly appear within the `$:` block will become dependencies of the reactive statement. For example, in the code below `total` will only update when `x` changes, but not `y`.

```svelte
<!--- file: App.svelte --->
<script>
	let x = 0;
	let y = 0;

	/** @param {number} value */
	function yPlusAValue(value) {
		return value + y;
	}

	$: total = yPlusAValue(x);
</script>

Total: {total}
<button on:click={() => x++}> Increment X </button>

<button on:click={() => y++}> Increment Y </button>
```

It is important to note that the reactive blocks are ordered via simple static analysis at compile time, and all the compiler looks at are the variables that are assigned to and used within the block itself, not in any functions called by them. This means that `yDependent` will not be updated when `x` is updated in the following example:

```svelte
<!--- file: App.svelte --->
<script>
	let x = 0;
	let y = 0;

	/** @param {number} value */
	function setY(value) {
		y = value;
	}

	$: yDependent = y;
	$: setY(x);
</script>
```

Moving the line `$: yDependent = y` below `$: setY(x)` will cause `yDependent` to be updated when `x` is updated.

If a statement consists entirely of an assignment to an undeclared variable, Svelte will inject a `let` declaration on your behalf.

```svelte
<!--- file: App.svelte --->
<script>
	/** @type {number} */
	export let num;

	// we don't need to declare `squared` and `cubed`
	// â€” Svelte does it for us
	$: squared = num * num;
	$: cubed = squared * num;
</script>
```

> In Svelte 5+, reactions are handled via the [`$derived`]($derived) and [`$effect`]($effect) runes
