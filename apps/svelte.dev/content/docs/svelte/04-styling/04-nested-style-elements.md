title: Nested <style> elements
---

There should only be 1 top-level `<style>` tag per component.

However, it is possible to have a `<style>` tag nested inside other elements or logic blocks.

In that case, the `<style>` tag will be inserted as-is into the DOM; no scoping or processing will be done on the `<style>` tag.

```svelte
<div>
	<style>
		/* this style tag will be inserted as-is */
		div {
			/* this will apply to all `<div>` elements in the DOM */
			color: red;
		}
	</style>
</div>
```
