title: Resources
---

This is the list of available resources provided by the MCP server. Resources are included by the user (not by the LLM) and are useful if you want to include specific knowledge in your session. For example, if you know that the component will need to use transitions you can include the transition documentation directly without asking the LLM to do it for you.

## doc-section

This dynamic resource allows you to add every section of the Svelte documentation as a resource. The URI looks like this `svelte://slug-of-the-docs.md` and the returned resource will contain the `llms.txt` version of the specific page you selected.
