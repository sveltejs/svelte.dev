The following tools are provided by the MCP server to the model, which can decide to call one or more of them during a session:

## list-sections

Provides a list of all the available documentation sections.

## get-documentation

Allows the model to get the full (and up-to-date) documentation for the requested sections directly from [svelte.dev/docs](/docs).

## svelte-autofixer

Uses static analysis to provide suggestions for the generated code. It should be invoked in a loop by the model until all issues and suggestions are resolved.

## playground-link

Generates an ephemeral playground link with the generated code. It's useful when the generated code is not written to a file in your project and you want to quickly test the generated solution. The code is not stored anywhere except the URL itself (which will often, as a consequence, be quite large).
