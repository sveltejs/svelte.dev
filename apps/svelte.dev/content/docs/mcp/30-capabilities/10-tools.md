title: Tools
---

This is the list of available tools provided by the MCP server. The list of tools is given to the model which can decide to call one or more of the tools during a session.

## list-sections

Provides a list of all the available documentation sections and their use cases if available. The titles of the sections will be used by the LLM to get up-to-date documentation directly from the official documentation.

## get-documentation

Allows the model to get the full documentation for the requested sections. The documentation is fetched on the fly from the official Svelte documentation and it will always be up to date.

## svelte-autofixer

Uses static analysis to provide suggestions for the generated code. It should be invoked in a loop by the model until all issues and suggestions are resolved.

## playground-link

Generates an ephemeral playground link with the generated code. It's useful when the generated code is not written to a file in your project and you want to quickly test the generated solution. The code is not stored anywhere, the server uses the `share-with-hash` functionality of the Svelte playground to generate the correct hash on the fly (which is also why it will generate a pretty big link).
