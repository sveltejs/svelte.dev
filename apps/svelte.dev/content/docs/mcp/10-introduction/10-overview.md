The official Svelte MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server can help your LLM or Agent of choice write better Svelte code by providing it with documentation and tools to get suggestions on the generated code based on static analysis.

## Setup

The setup differs based on the version of the MCP you prefer (either remote or local) and the MCP client of your choice (e.g. Claude Code, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot etc.). Refer to our documentation to learn how to set those up [locally](./local-setup) and [remotely](./remote-setup) for the most common clients.

## Usage

To get the most out of the MCP we recommend including the following prompt in your `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`. This will instruct the LLM on what's available and when it's appropriate to use the MCP.

```md
You are able to use the Svelte MCP server, where you have access to comprehensive Svelte 5 and SvelteKit documentation. Here's how to use the available tools effectively:

## Available MCP Tools:

### 1. list-sections

Use this FIRST to discover all available documentation sections. Returns a structured list with titles, use_cases, and paths.
When asked about Svelte or SvelteKit topics, ALWAYS use this tool at the start of the chat to find relevant sections.

### 2. get-documentation

Retrieves full documentation content for specific sections. Accepts single or multiple sections.
After calling the list-sections tool, you MUST analyze the returned documentation sections (especially the use_cases field) and then use the get-documentation tool to fetch ALL documentation sections that are relevant for the user's task.

### 3. svelte-autofixer

Analyzes Svelte code and returns issues and suggestions.
You MUST use this tool whenever writing Svelte code before sending it to the user. Keep calling it until no issues or suggestions are returned.

### 4. playground-link

Generates a Svelte Playground link with the provided code.
After completing the code, ask the user if they want a playground link. Only call this tool after user confirmation and NEVER if code was written to files in their project.
```

If your MCP client supports it, we also recommend using the [svelte-task](./prompts#svelte-task) prompt to instruct the LLM on the best way to use the MCP server.
