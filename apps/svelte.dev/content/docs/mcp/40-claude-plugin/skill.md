Claude Skills are sets of markdown files that live in your `.claude` folder (or that you can upload via the Claude web/desktop app). They are automatically loaded by Claude when it thinks they are appropriate for the current task.

With those markdown files you can steer the agent's behaviour and, in our case, teach it how to properly write Svelte 5 code. The advantage over the MCP server is that the relevant tokens are only loaded when they are needed (for example, if you ask the LLM to write a Typescript utility in a Svelte project it will not load the skill in the context).

You can find the skill inside the [`sveltejs/mcp`](https://github.com/sveltejs/mcp) repo in the [`plugins/svelte/skills`](https://github.com/sveltejs/mcp/tree/main/plugins/svelte/skills) folder. You can also download the latest zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/sveltejs/mcp/releases?q=svelte-code-writer) to load it in the Claude web/desktop app or to extract it inside your `.claude` folder.

If you are using Claude Code you can also install it through the [Svelte marketplace](plugin).
