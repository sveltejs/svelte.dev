The remote version of the MCP server is available on `https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp`.

Here's how to set it up in some common MCP clients:

## Claude Code

To include the remote MCP version in Claude Code, simply run the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add -t http -s [scope] [name] https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp
```

You can choose your preferred `scope` (it must be `user`, `project` or `local`) and `name`.

## Claude Desktop

- Open `Settings > Connectors`
- Click on `Add Custom Connector`
- Insert the name you prefer most
- Insert `https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp` as the `Remote MCP server URL`
- Click `Add`

## Codex CLI

Add the following to your `config.toml` (defaults to `~/.codex/config.toml`... refer to [the configuration documentation](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/69cb72f8422f2aa7222bea3a6ce48fd130fa76c4/docs/config.md) for more advanced setups):

```toml
experimental_use_rmcp_client = true
[mcp_servers.name]
url = "https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp"
```

To use HTTP servers in Codex you need to enable `experimental_use_rmcp_client` and the top level must be `mcp_server` but you can choose your preferred `name`.

## Gemini CLI

To include the remote MCP version in Gemini CLI, simply run the following command:

```bash
gemini mcp add -t http -s [scope] [name] https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp
```

You can choose your preferred `scope` (it must be `user`, `project` or `local`) and `name`.

## Opencode

Run the command:

```bash
opencode mcp add
```

and follow the instructions, selecting Remote when asked for "Select MCP server type":

```bash
opencode mcp add

┌  Add MCP server
│
◇  Enter MCP server name
│  [name]
│
◇  Select MCP server type
│  Remote
│
◇  Enter MCP server URL
│  https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp
```

You can choose your preferred `name`.

## VSCode

- Open the command Palette
- Select "MCP: Add Server..."
- Select "HTTP (HTTP or Server-Sent-Events)"
- Insert `https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp` in the input and press `Enter`
- Insert your preferred name
- Select if you want to add it as a `Global` or `Workspace` MCP server

## Cursor

- Open the command Palette
- Select "View: Open MCP Settings"
- Click on "Add custom MCP"

It will open a file with your MCP servers where you can add the following configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"[name]": {
			"url": "https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp"
		}
	}
}
```

The top level must be `mcpServers` but you can choose your preferred `name`.

## Other clients

If we didn't include the MCP client you are using, refer to their documentation for `remote` servers and use `https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp` as the URL.
