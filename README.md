# svelte.dev

To run this site, you must check out the code repositories into the `repos` directory. You may run `./apps/svelte.dev/scripts/sync-repos.js` to checkout any repos that do not already exist. If you'd like to work with a local copy of a code repository that you already have checked out, you may symlink it into this directory (e.g. `ln -s ../../kit repos/kit`).
